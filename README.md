# Finance Trading with Dollar Bars, CUSUM, and Triple Barrier Method

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build a primary trading model using dollar bars, the CUSUM filter, and the triple barrier method. The workflow is inspired by the work of Marcos López de Prado, who has contributed significantly to the field of finance trading.

In the notebook, we will guide you through various data processing techniques and methods to improve the reliability and accuracy of trading signals. We will cover the following topics:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Creating dollar bars from tick data
3. Generating trading events using the CUSUM filter
4. Implementing the triple barrier method


Stay tuned for future notebooks, where we will explore secondary models and machine learning techniques to further optimize our trading strategy and increase its profitability.

**Credits**: A special thanks to Marcos López de Prado for his invaluable contributions to the finance trading field and for inspiring the workflow presented in this notebook.
