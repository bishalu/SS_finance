# Finance Trading with Dollar Bars, CUSUM, and Triple Barrier Method

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build a primary trading model using dollar bars, the CUSUM filter, and the triple barrier method. 

Notebook: https://github.com/bishalu/SS_finance/blob/main/notebooks/01_primary_model.ipynb

Methods: https://github.com/bishalu/SS_finance/tree/main/utils

In the notebook, we will guide you through various data processing techniques and methods to improve the reliability and accuracy of trading signals. We will cover the following topics:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Creating dollar bars from tick data
3. Generating trading events using the CUSUM filter
4. Implementing the triple barrier method


Stay tuned for the next installments, where we will explore secondary models and machine learning techniques to further optimize our trading strategy and increase its profitability.
